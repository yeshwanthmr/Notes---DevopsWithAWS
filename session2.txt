what is computer?
==================
IP enabled device

laptop == mobile == server == chip == tv ==> computer
server ==> only to host applications

RAM, OS, HD, Processor --> IP enabled device

Client Server architecture

Networking between computers

1. Network
2. Facebook application

serve --> lawyer serves to us, we are his client

facebook is in Linux server, if problem comes we need to login to server..

https://www.joindevops.com

Protocol: https
Port: 443
IP: DNS IP
Username and password --> authentication

SSH --> Secure shell
Port: 22
IP, Username and password/private-key

Firewall --> checks inbound and outbound traffic

inbound --> incoming traffic --> port number 22, 103.149.59.114
outbound --> outgoing traffic

authentication
==================
1. what you know --> username password
2. what you have --> keys, tokens, authentication, rsa token
3. what you are --> fingerprint, retina, palm, face

Server == box == node

lock = public
key = private

key pairs --> public key and private key


1. create key pair
2. create firewall
3. import public key to aws account
4. create server and attach public key
5. attach firewall to server

Git Bash --> Mini Linux in windows
SSH client

browser --> http/https client
Linux Server --> SSH Server

git bash == putty == super putty == mobaxterm == mac terminal = windows cmd

ssh clients

pwd --> present working directory

User Directory
C:\Users\siva --> windows format
/c/Users/siva --> linux format

windows --> not case sensitive Siva == siva == Siva
Linux --> case sensitive --> Siva != siva no space in linux

/c/devops/daws-84s == C:\devops\daws-84s

ssh-keygen -f <file-name>

ssh-keygen -f daws-84s

ssh-rsa long-random-code 

Region --> us-east-1

0.0.0.0/0

98.81.70.98, 22, SSH, ec2-user, private-key

ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@98.81.70.98

OS --> Redhat, Ubuntu, centos, fedore, suse, oracle linux, amazon linux, debian, rocky linux, kali, solaris

Linux is os or not --> Linux is kernel

OS --> to interact with hardware

Kernal --> heart and brain of OS

Kernel + UI == OS

Redhat --> kernel + user interface ==> Redhat OS
Debian --> Linux kernel + UI ==> Debian

99.9% same all Linux distros/flavours

Redhat --> Open source --> code is free
Redhat enterprise RHEL --> support

RHEL = AWS Linux = Centos = Fedora = Rocky Linux = AlmaLinux

command <options> <inputs>

/home/ec2-user --> linux home directory
/c/users/siva --> windows home directory

cd --> change directory

cd .. --> one step back

ls --> list subdirectories
