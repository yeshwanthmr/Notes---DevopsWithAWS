Software Development Life Cycle
  -> Planning - Requirement analysis
  -> Design - General requirements to  physical requirements (LLD,HLD)
  -> Implentation
  -> Deployment
  -> Testing
  -> Monitoring

Waterfall vs Agile 

EX: School Management System
Stakeholders;
Parents
Students
Teachers

50 years back schools conduct onle once final exam 
Pass percentage : 40%

Day 1: 
Students : not serious about exams
Teachers : not serious about teaching
Parents  : They worry about their children from starting day

More Exams --> Process Change
Unit test - I, II, III, Quaterly , IV , Half yearly, grandtest

Day 30 (before 30 days exams)
Students : Not Serious
Teachers : Serious
Parents : Serious

Pass / Fail -> 25%,30%,35%,50%,70%(Final) (Improvement)
90% Literacy Rate

Slip-test --> Daily test ( 99% accuarcy literacy rate)
Students -> Serious
Teachers -> Serious
Parents -> Serious

IT Stake holders
Clients
Developers
Testers 
Operations
Users

Waterfall:
  Once requirements are fixed we can't change
  2 years project to go for production
  last 1 year
  last 1 month deploy : 100 defects
  20 invalid defects + 80 valid defects

Agile:
  item -> 1 test -> 2 defects
  1000 test -> 3 defects
  Final Product -> Multiple Modules -> Sprints
  Login and SignUp --> Sprint 1 (30 Days time)
  Orders
  Menu
  Payment
  Shipping
  Cart
  review
  employees

  Sprint 1 : Clients UAT (User acceptance Testing)
  daily standups
  95% -> 5 total defects,1 invalid defect and 4 valid defects

  Sprint 2 : Orders + 4 defects
  15 days development 15 days testing & deployment

  Process Change -> Devops
  SignUp and Login -> Enter first name , Enter last name , Enter DOB
  Deploy the same day , test on the same day
  10 defects -> 1 invalid defect


What is DevOps ?
Devops is a process of buliding,deploying,testing the code written by developer on same day instead of doing after complete develoment
We can achieve by using continuos integration, continuos deployment , continuos testing , continuos delivering
We can do faster released with less defects using devops with agile 
Basically automation mindset to get the best results.

Linux VS Unix
Unix : Hardware and Software (OS) together (disadvantges)
CPU , RAM , HardWare , Os(Software)
Laptop == IBM Bios

Linux:
From the Stratch Using C Language based on UNIX Principles He invented git to store this

Windows (Disadvantages)'
not Open Source
Costly
not Secure install anti virus
to many graphics
frequent restarts
tough to update or upgrade

Linux : 9MB
Secore
free
low resouces'install or update packages is easy
high speed - > mostly text
